# How to contribute to R4Econ

Right now, add whatever you want in new folders/docs - I have to get organized and then I'll set up a file structure with one for example code (and/or pseudo code, which I hear is very cool!) and one for resources, at least. 

Other docs might come up / better organization might be by what we're trying to do. For example, balance tables! Why are there no good online resources for creating standard econ balance tables in R???

## Resources for using GitHub
* [GitHub official guides](https://guides.github.com/) to things like Issues / Forking / the GitHub flow / a Hello World tutorial.

* [Gentzkow and Shapiro RA manual on GitHub](https://github.com/gslab-econ/ra-manual/wiki) and [summary of their guidelines on replicable work and version control](https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/CodeAndData.pdf) - a good read regardless of whether you use GitHub for typical projects

* [Pull request / forking guide](https://www.thinkful.com/learn/github-pull-request-tutorial/#Time-to-Submit-Your-First-PR) - Haven't checked this out yet but it seems like it could be good
